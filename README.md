# Pose-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning
  Pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, which mainly performs the detection
  and tracking of human body parts. It plays a crucial role in a wide range of
  applications, from human-computer interaction to motion analysis and sports
  analytics,and many more areas. This project explores the applications of various ML/DL algorithms like SVM(rbf,poly,linear),
  Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,Gaussian Naive Bayes,etc. and also MediaPipe, to the task of human pose estimation.
  The aim of this project is to accurately detect and track the movements and positions of human body in
  real-time.
